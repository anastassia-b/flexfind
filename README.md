# FlexFind

### Background
At App Academy, there is a capstone group project called the "Flex Project". Teams of 2-5 people have 2 weeks to implement a complete, workable product. "Flex" comes from the "flexible" technologies these teams use-- they are required to learn and use something new (a database, a language, a framework, etc.).

### Overview
**Problem: ** Presently, there is no resource to peruse all of the final Flex projects. While they get submitted to the reviewer individually, other students cannot easily search and view their peer's group projects.

**Solution: ** FlexFind aims to solve that problem by using the GitHub API to parse through student repositories and figure out which one corresponds to the flex project.

### Implementation

* GitHUB API / Octokit gem
